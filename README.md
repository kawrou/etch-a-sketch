# etch-a-sketch

Creating a browser etch-a-sketch from the Odin Project. 
Basic steps were given such as creating a grid and using hover. 
However no code was given. 
Look at: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

By the end a user whould be able to:
- Select how many squares per side they want but clicking on a button and receiving a prompt.
- change the colour of the squares by hovering their mouse over it.

Bonus: 
- each interaction randomizes the squares RGB
OR
- adds 10% more black to the square per interaction

To complete this project, I will need to use:
CSS
HTML
JS
DOM manipulation
git commands
